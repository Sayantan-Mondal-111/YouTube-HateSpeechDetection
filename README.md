# YouTube-HateSpeechDetection
Objective: Find the most effective ML algorithms for detecting hate speech in Youtube comments by training 4 models with 3 feature sets &amp; evaluating them using specified metrics.
The main objective of my study is to investigate the effectiveness of various machine learning algorithms for detecting hate speech in YouTube comments. The algorithm used here were categorize comments as either hate speech or not. To accomplish this, I trained four models using three different feature sets derived from the dataset. Evaluation of the models was performed by computing established evaluation metrics and comparing their results. 

It is important to understand that the detection of hate speech is not a comprehensive solution, but rather a step towards its prevention. My project focuses primarily on the detection aspect, but it is equally important to consider preventive measures. Some potential actions that can be taken include removal or flagging of comments for review by moderators, offering support and counseling for those affected, and reporting illegal hate speech to the authorities.
