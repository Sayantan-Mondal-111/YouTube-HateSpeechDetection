"As much as I love romantic comedies, their prevalence is responsible for so many heinous relationship issues. from the time that we are little girls and young men, we are indoctrinated with these stories about happily ever afters. The goal is getting in the relationship itself, and nothing afterwards is ever shown. Lies, deceit, and harassment are often considered ok as long as you REALLY like the person. Being a jerk is overlooked as long as you're rich and handsome. Women are encouraged to overlook problematic behavior as long as a ""grand gesture"" is made. Characters are caricatures and are either all good or all bad, because they are trying to point out who to root for. Relationships are put on this pedestal... Ending up single is not an option. I am glad to see that some of these problematic things are beginning to get noticed.",0

"@Natasha Vermeer I would actually tend to say feminism is ushering in a return to polygamy. Hook up culture is just an expression of hypergamy in a society that doesn't have a formalized structure of polygamy. But men still face the cultural notion that they're losers or failures if they can't get girlfriends, as such social notions were necessary under a monogamous social structure. Too many men running off for the bachelor life doesn't work. It's therefore unsurprising you have a certain number of very frustrated young men that on one hand are getting brow beat with the idea you're a looser if you can't date, and the reality that women are choosing hook up harems over traditional relationships.",1

"hopeless romantic yes, i did read what you wrote, please don't be rude as i have mentioned i am being respectful of your opinions. bring up the gang part, i didn't see much of it to be as relevant. the part about the male roles you talked about have been made for centuries because of the fact that white males were the only one's to own land and all the other stuff that came with it. now, yes most men are told to ""man up"" since they are young because that's what was taught all these years and it still is apart of society today just as the roles that were place on women which i can't really remember at the moment. the roles in the household are that the males are to support the family cause that was what they did since they could get jobs and own land. yes, i agree that men should be ridiculed for crying of somethings cause they should be able to show emotion. the pet where asking for help, i don't really see that happening as many people men and women have asked for help and nothing has really been a problem, maybe it isn't as relevant in today's society as much but for some people. men going to jail longer than women for the same crime but longer could be just because of how people are viewing men because of earlier occurrences which should never be taken as evidence. as something that is relevant to that, black males have committed the same crimes as white males but get longer because of their race and it happens with many other races as well. the thing about sexual assault is certainly a crime and they should be committed depending on how long the judge says. not many females are seen doing it and the sentence is different depending on what they did. the mass shootings and stuff about people trying to see if the women and children are okay is totally not that they don't care about the men it's just they want to check on the children to see if they are okay and for the women you never know if they are pregnant or anything. they do check to see if the men are okay, they check to see if EVERYONE is okay cause that's their job. i don't know l, i've never heard or seen people not checking to see if all people are okay in those situations but that's my say not anyone else's. as a conclusion on what i have read from both parties, men and women are being oppressed for different things and people need to acknowledge that and it's up to society to give everyone a fair time on the earth. as i have said, i respect your opinion and everything you say.",0

"<U+200B>@grimJT I prefer one of them being initially straight because that would be the base for her character development. The fear to openly embrace a new identity against her already established social life would be the main antagonist force of the story.
It's obviously unrealistic since people don't change their sexual orientation (they can hide or repress it for half their life but not genuinely change it) but all rom-coms must have something to dream about even if we know it could never happen. Finding out that the guy the girl is dating is actually a prince is pretty unrealistic: a straight perfect woman is the lesbian's prince in this case.
And she would be the one competing, her reluctance to openly take her as her girlfriend would be the cause of the fight and the lesbian one decides to break the relation because of that. But eventually she realizes that she prefers to be with her even in secret than to lose her forever, so she shows up at the competition and when the other girl wins she rushes to her and they passionately kiss in front of everybody.. and fade to black.",0

And when I expressed any emotion that wasn't positive I was being moody, or having jokes made about it being that time of the month for me, when I waS SIX FUCKING YEARS OLD!!!! Not to mention when I was older and grown ass men started harassing me, and boys my age started to flirt with me and call me a bitch when I told them nicely I wasn't interested.

I'd make the plot revolve around figure skating for extra cheese, or some other competitive activity that one of them is trying to pursue in parallel to the love story, which she would obviously win after starting her last act doing not so well because they had a fight and it seemed that it was over, until she sees the other girl in the crowd smiling to her, giving her the confidence she need to win..",1

"Uh yeah, no. You clearly don't understand being challenged in the way these poor guys are. Your advice is like telling a deranged schizo, ""just stop freaking out. Calm down bro lol."" 
No amount of hobbies, styling or talking to people will lead to any lays if the very essence of your being immediately turns people off before you even have a chance to say hello. 
For example: Take a guy with incel mentality (crippling sense of alienation and victimhood, most likely bullied)(all caused by things that weren't his fault in the first place) and imagine he tries to go out and socialize. It doesn't take a genius to see how that goes. See your mindset shows up in your aura and can be palpably felt by others and especially women.
Now to make matters worse, women today are the most rotten arrogant c*nts the world has ever seen. So even if the incel has pure intentions of just looking to find a suitable partner, the ladies will be quick to reject them and run away at best. Because behind all the glamour women are still primitive beasts that are driven purely by instinct and utterly incapable of looking beyond surface appearances. Thus for the average incel, finding a romantic partner is more futile than climbing Yosemite rock blind folded, drunk and with one arm tied behind his back.",1

Seems like a risky move to try to get him on terrorist charges more likelihood he won't get the proper sentence if there's no precedent for it.

I am a cynic when it comes to relationships. i am a child of divorce, i have had a bad experience with a horrible ex and i am queer so it means i am more of a realist. my brother sadly is a bit too much of a romantic and an optimist. not that its a bad thing its just sometimes can stop you from seeing the truth.",1

3. chubby girl must be the bad one, a lunatic and frustrated. Well, at least in this movie she wins, which is rare

4. if you have problems with yr gf, proposing makes sense and it will sort things out. 

I still dont buy that they post a video instead of calling the police and that nobody takes their video seriously",1
What the fuck did I watched. The video is amazing but the movie is shit and it sucks,1
"""While looking through the footage they've taken so far, Claire can't help looking at a clip of Rebecca over and and over where her face looks particularly disturbing.""

Umm, that's called a smile.",0

Good recap. shit movie.,1
They had no survival instincts <U+0001F613>,0
"Ah yes a maniacal killer is pursuing me, so I'll go to the house that she has full control of to hide and not to the car to escape",0
going back to the killers house was stupid and now i'm kind of glad they got killed for chasing clout,0
Darn subaru,0
"so many stupid mistakes, it was 2 on 1 and it was only a women with a knife, they could of taken her out..",0
If among us has taught me anything it�s that you shouldn�t stay on cams for too long,0
I feel like teddy is the only part I really liked about this movie. Just him.,0
"i usually am totally fine with horror movies, i love them. but rebecca was so creepy. her smile, the glowing eyes, everything is psychopathic and terrifying. i almost had to stop watching.",0
I need season 2 cause I need to know if the killer have been caught,0
"why follow the crazy lady in the woods for a ""surprise"" that literally sounds like she wants to stab you already",0
Bro if i see a girl outside of my house and blood on her shirt and is holding a knife and threating me then ima go full force and put her down then call the police lol because i dont want to see a person who has blood on them out side my house because thats just creepy lol so i will just get it over it and go full force and take the person down and call the cops lol,0
they had sooo many chances and still fucked up,1
"Don't get me wrong knives are dangerous. But ain't no way imma let a crazy teenager get the best of me.

Boi ain't no way boi.",0
This has to be the dumbest home invasion thriller I've seen. Such a sad couple who are just totally dumb and helpless.,1
Working car in horror movies< Cabin full of guns and swords,0
"The girl deserved what she got after turning down the guy's proposal. Poor guy tho, he deserved better.",1
"bruh, you should be able to overpower her, weak playa",1
My name is Rebecca,0
Intriguing <U+0001F601><U+0001F44D>,0
"The thing that always irritates me about these is how they don't use their numerical advantage. In this it was 2 v 1 and as far as they know, Rebecca doesn't have a gun. She may be crazy, but she's just one person. I know the initial shock of seeing someone get killed frightened them, but after that fear comes the instinct to fight. In real life, people don't always become weak cowards the way these movies make the victims out to be. What would actually happen is after initially running away, they arm themselves with what ever they can and muster the courage to go to the car to escape.",0
"This movie is beyond stupid.
I don't know how you can stand to watch this type of films man.
You have a gift there, I would be throwing my remote control at the screen from their stupidity <U+0001F644>. 
For real tho, how the hell did they managed to get kill in this type of scenario?
And worst, how did the guy get stab when he obviously had a better and longer weapon.
He had a metal pick that he could have stab that psycho with before she even got close.
How dumb <U+0001F612>",0
"What�s the movie name , is there more to it? Part 2?",0
2 vs 1 and they can't beat her... sigh.,0
"like they say, ""too much attention can kill you"" which could probably is true, taking a random selfie at the highest point for most views or at most dangerous moment then dies right after....
basically created n made it their own hell",0
I would have been so mad if I had watched this movie. Such a shit movie.,1
9:27 �the couple decides to go back to the house.� Oh come on� stopped watching at that point.,0
It�s funny that the weak ass people can�t beat a crazy women,1
"Typical moron behavior. Our relationship isn't working so let's get married, that'll fix everything. <U+0001F644><U+0001F926><U+0001F937><U+0001F602><U+0001F602><U+0001F602>",1
U ran off from her getting a clear head start but instead u run to the killers house because u feel she is gonna do some Jason Voorhees shit and be at the car before u....she only got a knife so even if u were to run to the house u ain't think to grab something to use as a weapon??? Movie logic,0
I imagine there are YouTube channels that do the same thing as these people,0
Claire has to be the dumbest person ever. Only thing she cared about is making a good video and it got them both killed <U+0001F926><U+0001F3FE><U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F>,1
I�m not too sure but this almost looks like the same house from SCP Overlord,0
"Fun fact, if you call 911 without a signal it will still call it",0
"Its funny how many travel influencers could relate to certain elements of this story lol 
I bet every single person who comments this video (by the way) is going to go through the rest of their entire lives never realizing the astonishing fact that my website sets the world record for the amount of epic rainbows ever captured from a helicopter in the history of the rainbow state! I'm wondering how many people who read this comment to the end will take the time to search my name and my heli website on the internet!",0
"""She's alone. She doesn't have a firearm. And there are two of us."" 
""Right. So let's split up. You stay here while I go down to the basement and make sure to keep my back to the only entrance and exit.""",0
"Ah, yes, Gen Z live and in color! A crazy lady killing a Boomer couple for not getting her will and... yes, and then there is Teddy... <U+0001F60C>

Hahhaahha,0
Omg it's Kevin from Supernatural,0

Why would they run if it's two against one,0
A that's Kevin tran from supernatural,0
How did they let one woman take them out like that? Lol! No wonder she didn't take him serious when he purposed,0
what happen if movie recap get the same problem......,0
They shouldn't comeback to the house after Rebecca acts very SUS,0
Kevin Tran and Aunt Jenna make a weird couple...... but whatever <U+0001F644> <U+0001F602><U+0001F923>,0
Damns they even did my boy Kevin wrong here too <U+0001F62D> <U+0001F972>,0
This movie is cringe,1
if they have not posted n years they wlll start to suspect it is real,0
Such stupid movie... Doesn't make sense at all...,0
Why does the killer look like Billie Eilish,0
This has to be one of the stupidest movies out there so called man is running away from my girl with car keys two adults,1
Looks like an absolutely dreadful movie.,0
Terrible movie.,0
"i hate this movie
thanks for the recap, so i dont watch that crap",0
The dark side of youtube,1
Ggyyyyyyyy,0
"It's 2021 and people still believe they need a ""signal"" to call the emergency line lol",0
I dont understand why she killed her pretend friend <U+0001F615>,0
Click bait lel,0
Thank God Movie Recaps is here and save me from wasting more than an hour of my life watching the full length of this stup!d film!,0
"Evidence piles up and she thinks, this is a great idea for a video... 

Internet fame is one hell of a drug.",1
"It�s always weird watching these because the killer is just human. It�s weird, It�s not like they are Michael Myers",0
dumb movie lmao,1
Why does every horror movie ever fail to recognize the fact that you don't need service to call an emergency line?,0
Thank goodness I never watched this video in full. Stupid movie.,0
"super host? shouldve just titled it ""KAREN"" <U+0001F601>",1
If Teddy keeped his damn mouth closed,0
"Movie reminds me of ""Spree""",0
If stupidity were a couple,1
This movie started okay and then went down hell with stupidity of everyone even the killer,0
This is why no one should clickbait<U+0001F62D>,1
Knockoff of spree,0
This story was kinda dumb like what was rebbaca deal she's just a crazy chick 8n the forest,0
That's a demonic possessed Karen,0
Why didn�t they call 911 !,0
Before I watch it like scary story,0
Literally karma to these two clout chasers.... They got tricked several times and ended up in their death just because they wanted youtube fame-,0
this movie doesnt make sense at all and the way it finishes as well it leaves us wondering who is the starring,0
"As a small time youtuber, should i be scared now?<U+0001F605>",0
Although Rebecca is creepy she looks cute tho,0
That uploaded SOS video is perfect evidence if they go missing long enough.,0
"She doesn�t even have a gun, just a knife.",0
*this is like yandere sim irl*,0
"y�all,don�t be like those viewers 
there are maniacs out there",1
"oh no I'm being chased by a killer and i found a working computer with internet access, how do i alert the authorities? lemme upload a video",0
I don't get why in movies the people inside the car always had to stop their journey just cuz a single person is blocking their way. Just swerve away? I mean if it's a bad guy just run them over.,1
Hi Jenna,0
6:13 This is probably just like the movie Creep/creep 2 with Michael Douplass. Great movie she probably killed the owners.,0
"No place is like home...
Stay home stay safe.. dont wander around",0
Spree,0
"They should've just went back to the car and drive off ,i swear ppl in horror movies have IQ of an peanut",0
That place has too many security cameras for my liking....I Couldn't get comfortable knowing I'm being watched,0
Why does no one believe in the second amendment?,0
I wonder why the closed captioning calls the movie 'Knock Knock' as you're saying 'Superhost' ?,0
the smart move is to go to the side of the forest in the froest but not fully and follow the road,0
i mean i will give her a good review,0
Nice,0
"The moment I heard the words ""YouTuber / Influencer"" in the script I was immediately on the Killer's side.",1
"The number of bad decisions this couple makes is painful to watch. The strange behaviour of the host would seem quirky and eccentric at first, but fairly quickly it escalates to the point that it's obvious she's crazy. Entering the house while they sleep to make breakfast (Pack your stuff!), speaking back to them through the security cameras (Grab your stuff and get out now!), seeing their laptop on their floor, playing their footage (RUN!!), realizing she's not the person who rented the place to them (RUN FAST!!!). Then they're in the car and can easily drive away to safety, but for some crazy reason, they agree to get out and follow her into the woods!! They don't even immediately run off when they see the 'body'!! Even then, after the 'prank', they still could have safely left, but Teddy brings up Betty and Lou instead of just going to the police about it! Then, instead of running to the safety of their car and driving away, they run back to the rental - the place she has the most control over!! One of the stupidest horror movie decisions ever! And then, instead of picking up a firewood axe, or a fire poker, or a knife, or a rolling pin, fire extinguisher, scissors or any 1 of a thousand things in a house that can be used as a weapon, they decide to SPLIT UP!! Two young, healthy adults -one of them a man- don't do anything to defend themselves, and make it super-easy for the crazy woman to kill them. Not that they deserve to die, but they sure made some dumb decisions. (Bad writing!!)",0
What's the name of music,0
"They think the woman is sus so they start leaving the house. But rather driving around her and leaving, they follow her into the woods for a surprise??!",0
Why Knock Knock on CC,0
Thanks to you it�s like i watched the movie which pretty handy when nowadays shitty movies get released <U+0001F618><U+0001F60C>,1
Is this fake?,0
I dont understand how he passed out from get slashed from a knife thats not realistic,0
Anther Shit movie!!!,1
This movie is so trash,1
Bru she has a Camera and a Knife and they still got Opped <U+0001F9D0><U+0001F480>,0
She is one woman armed with a knife. They are two. They easily have her there with only minor injuries,0
So basic cause the gf want to get more film they decide to trust her fuck that and what make it worse they deiced to go to the house where she got full control of and not the car where they think she may be wait bullshit they should add more scene to that line cause anyone would took that chance and plus it two of them they can jump her,0
Movie logic is always interesting.,0
"Nutjobs like teddy need to be cleansed from this world. Unless your attacker has a gun over you, there no reason to perish. Unfortunately men have more x-chromosome in their system than courage nowadays.",1
Maybe one day we'll actually get a horror movie that's scary because the characters make the right decisions and still lose.,0
No i will call for help the ppl commenting unsubscribed clickbate are serial killers there is a difference between vlog and prank and to be honest people in America have no humanity left,1
"Last scene is so stupid like two adults can be this dumb that they cannot defend themselves
Like Rebecca was not holding a gun or something",0
"LOL, wow... I mean, just.... Wow....",0
"This movie is stupid and very very stupid and makes no sense at all.. there is A guy and a girl vs 1 girl...2 vs 1... what is there for the couple to be scared of.. she is just a normal gal, they could just overpower her if they work together..the couple should be the ones scaring her.. not the other way around..all bs",1
Lol they never have signal,0
So kinda like Spree?,0
5:03 - you can suspend a channel single handedly ?? .. oops loophole ..,0
This movie doesn�t make sense to me,0
One weak ass beta male AND his girlfriend vs 1 women. Lol...so true these days.,1
Moral: dont usr internet for sos use emergency connections,0
Moral of the story: vloggers are dumb as rocks,1

One of the worst movie ever stupid couple what u can't even stand up to a little lady with a knife... Its 2 against 1..dude...,1
CRAZY <U+0001F92F>,0
I'm pretty sure people can tell if someone is acting or faking. Why would they assume it's clickbait?,0
The moral of the story-don't be a narcissist,1
Such a dumb movie,1
lmao claire a whole clown,0
"Finally, the OG channel, that still uses old narration Voice. Sir, I tip my hat to u",0
They had so many opportunities to escape. Smh,0

Exactly like real life . . . you only survive in fairy tales,0
"This is stupid, as a professional, the weapon the guy has had a really long range, and he could easily stab the girl from a pretty far away range, like a spear, she only had a kitchen knife, small range stoopid",0
Kevin Tran!,0
i call this one a happy ending,0
"Jesus, these people were stupid.",0
"I think *some* people might think the video was a hoax. But I've seen YouTube channel fans. In most cases they lean on the side of caution, and all it would take is just one of who knows how many thousands or millions of subscribers they have to be concerned and call the police. So I wouldn't assume I was safe because I saw a couple of comments calling the video clickbait.",1
This movie is hella dumb,1
Claire is the evil woman from Level 16 <U+0001F914>,0
You don�t need signal or a SIM card to call the police,0
how does a set of teeth clog a toilet?,0
Why did they make he Asian guy so weak in this movie? Also they never even showed the asian guy and his gf kiss. This was straight up racist,0

Anything for reviews? <U+0001F629> <U+0001F60F>sheeeeeeeeeeeeit,1
They could have literally fought her together so easily,0
"Bro. I would have been out of there if I saw that figure in the dark the first night. Also, why not just say no to her taking you in the woods and go home even after getting creeped tf out by her and leaving in the first place. So dumb but a good movie.",0
I never heard of this movie so it must have been terrible lmao.,0
Dumbest idea to not go to the car. What�s a lady gonna do to a car window?,0
Absolute shit of a plot <U+0001F61B>,1
"Thank god for this channel, save us alot of time with stupid movies like this.",0
Teddy is the definition of beta male...,0
"I really enjoy these videos, what is the background musics name?? It's really calming",0
Nothing like a millionth low budget thriller where the bad guy wins again. At least the made the characters smart... oh wait.,0
"They didn't go to the car first even though they ran to it first LOL, oh so realistic... UGGGGHHHH",0
bruh xd,0
"I kinda feel bad for the boyfriend. Yeah both of them were dumb but Clair was honestly a bitch caring more about the channel than their relationship. Dude proposes to you and you first thought it is ""THIS IS GREAT FOR THE CHANNEL GREAT IDEA!""",0
It's not funny to fake die and play around because when you actually need help you don't get it people think your playing but your not,0
That how dumb people are in youtube js clickbate how is it ckickbate cause clickbate is something they wanna see what happened which it showed properly cause if there saying is clickbate is something that was false and they click on the channel without seeing the stuff in the front of page of the video,0

It makes me so mad how the girl only cares about the channel,0
2:32 holy shit thats creepy,0
She would've got rocked the f,0
It's crazy how Ana Faris's character from the scary movie franchise would have had a better survival rate than these two.,0
This movie gives me plot holes in my brain. It hurts,0
90% of this is The girls fault lol,0
She gone get caught cause if they famous YouTubers and upload daily yea at first the fans may think its a joke but once a week pass 2 weeks they loyal fans will get worried and call,0

"I have so many questions
1. Was there no knife or sharp object they could have used to protect themselves before trying to look for a WiFi SiGnAl or going down into the basement

2. it's clear they have more than 10k following why couldn't they have started a Livestream with the computer In the basement or something (idk I just really think they could have done more to save themselves in this movie)",0
Oh look! Tik Tok trends,0
What is Jenna Gilbert and Kevin Tran doing here,0
This has more plot holes than a horror made in the 60s,0

I thought America had enough of 1 sided horror films in the 90's. This one is going on the Ignore List.,1
All of this could have been avoided if the boyfriend wasn�t a vegan who drank soy milk.,0
This film looks like a load of crap,1
"YouTube customer support doing their jobs in a timely manner, and giving the benefit of the doubt instead of just citing some arbitrary rule that only gets enforced against those YouTube's employees are politically opposed to?

Yup, clearly a work of fiction.",0
"I just saw the movie. They had every chance to leave and avoided being murdered. Teddy expressed it wasn�t good idea to follow rebecca into the woods, while claire�s selfish, dumb @$$ wanted to get more footage for likes and views. So it�s claire�s fault they got murdered for not heeding to the warning signs.",0
Why would you go out into a house in the middle of nowhere without a gun?????,0
The bf clearly calls the gf mommy with how much he sucks up to her...o yes this clearly pshyco girl wants to take us into the woods . Babe let's go with her,0

Snl literally did a skit about this a few weeks ago,0

This video was dumb if the couple stacked together at the end they would have been good it�s 1 man and 1 women vs 1 women like bruhhh,0
Imagine being a grown man and running away from a girl with a kitchen knife instead of trying to help the lady she is stabbing.,0
This is funny because you can call 911 without internet,0
"kevin tran, the simp prophet",0
"why didn't they ran for the car ? even if she were there, it would be a 2v1, they could overpower her, why tf they went back inside the house ?",0
Omg thats kevin from supernatural,0
This is why i train knives,0
Horror movie writers seems to have no common sense,1
The f**k? This is messed up� .,1
they don't use the car because they thought the killer would be waiting for them... so they went back to the house know the killer has control over the house? did they forget the killer even talked to them through the cameras? so the killer went free without getting caught. the killer is pretty smart ngl lol.,0
Idk why but Rebecca is kinda hot,0
She�s more concerned about clicks <U+0001F914>,0

"After going through the comments, i have decided not to continue......


Outta here__off to other recap<U+0001F6B6><U+0001F6B6>",0
It's really sad that people will immediately assume something like an SOS is clickbait. You'd think in a world more connected than ever we could signal when something is wrong! Although I would assume they would eventually realize this isn't the case when the couple goes missing and stops uploading.,0
"Moral of the story, don�t clickbait and be a honest and good YouTuber",0
Everything they did was pretty reasonable until they decided to run back to the house like why? You could had drove away or fought back since there's two of you,0
I love your video,0
"Bruh, I don�t get movies like this. Dude had a firepoker. A FIREPOKER. She had a tiny knife. He could�ve shoved the poker into her neck before she was even within 2 feet of his body. 

99% of the �killers� in these movies are easy as fuck to kill.",1
"She wasn�t supernatural, get things to beat her to death with, there�s two of you. �Let�s split up.�

Even watching this in recap form was painful.",0
So the elderly couple were the original owners. Who was Vera and where did Rebecca come from?,0
You know whats a good question? How did she get the keys to the car? The killer I mean. They only dropped the camera right?,0
"the fake host wasn't even that intimidating, two versus one and the two idiots split up instead of taking her head-on. No wonder their youtube channel was failing, they had no brains whatsoever.",1
I�m sorry but no way that small women ain�t killing that guy n girlfriend just 1 person with a knife ima house full of weapons I can�t with these dumb horrible horror shii<U+0001F602><U+0001F62D>,0
"Now I remember @Teddy is the guy from the 'Supernatural', where he played as 'Kevin tran' aka the 'prophet', where he who's the only person, which can read the ""God tablet"" and translate it",0
is this story real?,0
What a dumb ass movie,1
ok smartphones now is capable to make emergency calls without signal. i would like to watch it tho,0
so stupid he had a weapon and ran what,0
"Am i the only one who thinks that the boyfriend was possibly one of the wimpiest men on the planet? The two of them couldn't over power one woman???? Yeah she had a knife, but the guy had a poker iron which is longer and sharp also. And don't get me started on running to the house instead of the car.",1
Why did her eyes glow at night ?,0
"I would have gotten the fuck out of there after the first night when he saw Rebecca in the woods, the shining eye thing is because of an extra layer in the eye of nocturnal animals, it reflects photons so the eye can capture more, humans do not have this. xD",0
You mean to say two people couldn�t take on One crazy gal an knock her the clean out <U+0001F635><U+200D><U+0001F4AB>,1

The girl youtuber in the couple was the biggest clown and I feel bad for the guy,0
this is a bad fucking movie i will never watch is in my life is is trash!,1
"i can see why they casted an asian dude for this role, thanks hollywood",1
<U+0001F602> it�s like the killer is supernatural and unkillable.,0
Definition of useless boyfriend,0
They were too hungry for clout. You don't need signal to make an emergency call,0
"That�s right big smiles everyone�s happy type beat 

Especially grandma after her spongebath",0
Ah yes a bunch of CW refugees,1
This couple was so stupid,0
You're telling me this man couldn't over power 1 untrained woman <U+0001F926><U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F>,1
This movie was really realistic. It was almost as bad as an actual YouTube vlog,0
"Nah I hate movies like this, was hoping that crazy chich would lose <U+0001F643>",0
What if it was all a prank to get the subscribers back and they still alive and fooling us lol,0
Wow intensive,0
That was awesome . I liked the fake out kill in the woods .,0
Wow they really made a movie referencing losing subscribers on YouTube lol times are definitely changing,0
This Reminds Me Of The 2020 Horror Movie Spree,0
Extremely stupid movie. Gory and nothing more,1
Follow us <U+2764><U+FE0F>,0
"The couple ends up dying, but at least they sacrificed their lives to bring down a monster.",0
Not going to the car and not simultaneously attacking her crazy ass is the reason they died,0
The film reminds me of wolf creek that's a god awful film and this is just cringey and predictable and for being horror well it's as scary as a plant pot.,0
"0:25 ""They've been borrowing money from Teddy's parents to survive""
""But he's planning to make things better by proposing to Clair...""
Ah, yes, in debt, but proceeds to buy a wedding ring to propose because a ring will definitely make all the problems magically disappear in a relationship. Scary thing is, people actually think like this in real life...",0
:/ I would have still hold onto that poker because you could have used it and saved the girl,0
"This movie is terrible,enough said.",0
"2 minutes into this video and my intuition is already telling me to grab my Glock and put it in my pocket. Also this is a normal ass chick. I�d backhand her so hard her neck snaps. ALSO ALSO. The youtuber notices the computer has wifi, So instead of contacting someone she decides to upload a YouTube video? Jeeeeesus",0
This actually happened. Watched a video about a YouTube couple with a similar story. They both died,0
Oh no the continuation of that guy who killed several people for views but now it�s a woman rental host.,0
Their first mistake was not driving around the CRAZY person in the middle of the road,0
Awful movie,1
If crazy hot was in the dictionary omg lol,0
I am feeling guilty now as a viewer.,1
Kevin! Supernatural homies know,0
Mr Beast be like when he had enough,0
What is the movie name please?,0
Why the subtitle in the beginning is incorrect?,0
dude 3 in a day,0
Wow Rebecca is really cute. I'd forgive her,0
It literally 2 people! One was a whole dude! <U+0001F926><U+0001F3FE><U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F>,0
Awesome thumbnail,0
"worst part is, everything that's been recorded will be claimed by someone else and yt wont do crap about it",0
need the background music. help plis. It's soooo soothing.,0
Loved it :=:,0
Literally the premise of all of these type of movies could be solved it just one person in the friend group owned a fucking gun.,0
"9:37 Fun fact that could save your life, if you have no signal it's still a good idea to call 911. An emergency call will go through any means necessary to reach 911. That means that it will go through other signals towers and satellites even if you're not usually permitted to go through in ordinary circumstances. While this probably wouldn't work in this situation due to them being in the middle of nowhere, you should still attempt to call 911 in an emergency, even if you don't have signal.

Edit: I was multitasking when I initially wrote this, so I had to fix a couple grammatical mistakes.",0
"Ah yes the good old ""try and reason with an unhinged killer instead of killing her"" trope.",0
Thank you for saving me a few hours of my life!,0
"It was a 2v1, they could have easily overpowered her and killed her",0
Aunt jenna noo!,0
bet their channel will blow up when people see them dead in the news,0
What a stupid.....STUPID movie!,1
They have internet access but can't call 911. What a b********t.,1
Ugh I'm done,0
"10:25 ""She watches Teddy get a fire poker to defend herself"" 
*facepalm*",0
Don't you love it when people in movies can't defend themselves? I do.,0
Claire really got both of them killed. She risked trying to grab at money knowing that Rebecca was behaving creepy as hell.,0
"Superhost

this whole plot is just dumb.. like they could have easily overpowered 1 girl with a knife its hilarious xD,0
It is Kevin from supernatural!$$,0
2v1 and still lost.. what a noob :),0
That�s how that YouTube hustle be though sometimes��,0
"this Claire, she is really annoying",0
If I were that girl I would not accept a ring from a dude that runs away to save him silf ... Seriously what has happened to men! Personally I am not the type of person that runs away from danger,0
How is a man gunna be scared of a little fat girl.,1
they were stupid.. asf,1
A lot of people saying how they didn't run to the car and the house instead cuz she would be there but..... the killer had the car keys anyway so f their logic and the comment sections I guess?,0
"Pretty much one of those shitty horror logic movies, almost like a B rated movie lmao",1
"Most beta guy,I have ever seen in a movie....",1
What a weak dude. Didn�t even try to fight back till they�re in the house? Wth,1
"It�s silly that both of them couldn�t come up with a simple plan to take that crazy bytch out , considering she didn�t have superhuman strength, and her weapon of choice was nice .",0
A great promo film for Airbnb.,0
"Movie recaps 'knock knock superhost'
So They dont have service on but the computer had signal wifi and They didnt check the house completely.
What a film, almost like any other film.
Great summary, mate.",0
"Home alone: small child fend off thugs
This movie: Two adults drown in fear from the sight of a woman, and proceed to get butchered by her
Someone should just do a home alone style movie where a dumb crazy sociopath get owned by a small child.",0
Teddy & Claire are two dummies,0
"Alright, so I see Kevin, and is that Hael the angel as well from Supernatural?",0
Woke men cannot protect their girlfriend from a 5 feet tall lunatic girl.,0
Terrible writing and zero logic behind this movie,1
A fully grown man and his girlfriend in a house full of weapons can't over power a small woman with only a knife?,0
Why not just fight her??,0
"You have 3 options when under attack. Fight, flight or just be stupid",0
This guy looks like David2D hahahah,0
"The day there will be signal everywhere in the forest/mountain, the horror film industry will go bankrupt",1
Ok but I just realised that the male main lead is similar looking as Minho from shinee....,0
"10:43 couldn�t she contact the police trough internet?? Instead of uploading whole ass video file on YouTube?? Even small videos take time to upload here, and she is in the middle of a wood with shitty signal.",1
"The one mistake at the end is the fact once they notice no uploads going on, it�ll end up in an unsolved mysteries case video <U+0001F602>",0
I love all these channels,0
Am I tripping or did these 2 people and MAN and woman spend half the movie running from 1 woman with a knife??? Why were they running they couldn�t over power her??? I could see if she had a gun or zombie powers but she was just a regular lady. I don�t get it. I kept thinking why doesn�t this guy just kick her ass??,0
The beginning of ww3 has began.,0
This movie has no common sense don't watch if you wanna be irritated,0
and that is why you don't pick a wimpy feminine guy as your husband. what a pathetic little man. couldn't even beat a girl,1
"This movie was trash what the hell, none of it made sense and I feel like everyone involved had 3 brain cells all together",1
Two people afraid of a lil girl with only a lil freakin knife! GTFOH! <U+0001F923>,0
if she had internet slightly then she had a chance to live stream which could have boosted the chance of them actually getting help but might still not work,0
I live for these,0

moral of the story: true love needs no clicks and likes.,0
Yeah I�m still attracted to the crazy chick. Going to go see a therapist now <U+0001F44C>,1
He had a fireplace poker but doesn't use it? They never grabbed a knife? These people deserved to die. In the woods he could have at least looked for a sharp stick,0
"when two people are afraid of a girl with a knife, not a gun just a knife, just get/make long weponds from the house wear extra clothings and charge that bitch.",0
YouTube isn�t working for them so why don�t they get a job and why tf people don�t have common sense in horror movies<U+0001F62D>,1
They could�ve escaped if they simply did not go with the girl in the woods when they were leaving. His girl is so stupid,0
"I would have been like: girl, you either move out the way or I�m going to run you down",0
I'm so angry i wanna give them dirty slaps,0

ANOTHER FEEAT ONE THANK YOU <U+0001F64F>,0
"When running from a killer the best choice is to GO AWAY from the obvious house that has a fully lock system, with security cams installed.",0
Why run? Just take out that bitch. She only had a knife.,0
"Michael myers would have no problem having this girl as his sister. Like jesus, christ, the way she emulates the shape with additional glowing eyes, effing hell. Heck even Freddy would find her interesting.",0
Hilarious.,0
Lol thought this was a loser fruit video,0
i think the girl was genuinely laughing in the thumbnail,0
"good acting, garbage plot.",0
Basically Tanmay Bhat female version...,0
oh boy.. Another hanging end; more tripping at the finish line.,0
Beta male afraid of a crazy woman.,1
"This was a pretty bad movie. First off, plenty of times they could have easily gotten away.
Second time, that chick was crazy, but like, when I noticed at the very least that she'd stabbed Vera after getting caught, my next move wouldn't even have been to go back to the house, i'd be staying in those woods, creating traps and sharp stabbing weapons and stalking her tiny ass down for some Hannibal Lecter style revenge.",1
She try�s to call the police but there is no signal. Since when did you need wi-fi to call 911?,0
Hugs,0
Yo,0
Everything's fun and games until the security camera talks back.,0
Yaya happy ending <U+0001F606>,0
now that youtube is not showing dislikes. i can press dislike without guilt. sorry channel.,0
2 against 1 and 2 ran wtf,0
The actor who played Teddy looks SO familiar....,0
if only they could just run back to the car instead of running to the house XD,0

I loved the title made me wanna jump into watching it.. <U+0001F525>,0
Teddy is such a little wimp.,0
comedy,0
The worst part of this movie is that it is.,0

"Damn Kevin, I thought all this shit was behind you when you ditched the Winchester's!",1
"20 years of ""small women can beat up everyone, even big men""-nonsense out of Hollywood has led to a place where we are watching a movie about a couple, including a able bodied man, being afraid of a 5 foot woman and acting as if she were a 9 foot grizzly bear, even when she isn't holding a weapon at the time.
This is so dumb, I can't even tell if it is a parody.",0
just saw this,0
Well I guess now we may see less Vlogs. Need one movie about Flight Reviews Too <U+0001F600>,0
What a coward! She just killed his girlfriend and he just retreats instead of fighting her with his longer range weapon,1
"Wow, they should make a movie out of this",0
"they don't use the car because they thought the killer would be waiting for them... so they go to the killer's house knowing the killer has complete control of said house? yeah, that makes sense.",0
"I like how movie recaps is always very considerate of his audience like he always makes sure to say and puts the movie title in writing first so people know what movie they are about to watch, does the same when he introduces new characters and my personal favourite is when he blurs out the gory stuff. So, thnks movie recaps.",0
"My relationship is rocky, what can I do to fix it? 
P R O P O S E",0
Funniest thing is...one chubby small chick is terrorizing them hahaha,0
"Nobody in horror movies ever has any common sense. Oh no let�s not go to our car and gtfo, lets run back into the house she has control of and hide there knowing there are security cameras everywhere <U+0001F926><U+0001F3FD><U+200D><U+2640><U+FE0F>",1
This isn�t accurate since modern phones can call emergency services with no signal <U+0001F610>,0
Fact : This recap is also uploaded on YouTube <U+0001F923>,0
"The worst part is that she won't get caught any time soon because their viewers thought that the

"@TheHowlers - Well, they're BOTH acting stupidly, that's for sure. (And it's perfectly fine that he's frightened, any sane person would be.) I only mentioned he's a man because typically a man, even a small man, is stronger than a woman. (Not always, but most of the time.)",0

Sure, sometimes the bad decisions aren't really bad, they're just normal decisions that lead to bad thing because there's a psycho around, but that probably depends on how much we're supposed to sympathize with the victim(s).

clearly you have not faced a deranged person wielding a knife before.,0

The Young boys weigh less, they are smaller, they are not as strong. But in a fight it is more than just that. It fast twitch muscles, speed, many more things than just size and strength.

@genericnameinc a knife has zero range. he had a fire poker. best option was to smash her with it,0
"To be fair: running away from someone with a knife is always the most reasonable response, even if you are favoured in the fight. The person with the knife just needs to get one lucky stab in and you're done for. Even if you win, there's a good chance that you'll bleed out before help arrives if she hits the right spots. That being said: he totally should have just grappled her when she stabbed him. It's almost certain that he'd win. Running with a wound is just stupid. Better make use of the time you're still under adrenaline and in grapple range to overpower your weaker opponent. Worry about surviving your wound after the threat has been neutralized.",0
"@ClearMindJoker ye thanks. the couple made stupid decisions, why would you split up thats litterly the worst decision ever. would make sense if you were both stronger than the person you were hunting but they have no experiance to kill",0
@Plagu3 Well said. No excuse when you had objects that can be used as a weapon in the house that could've helped them survive. While Mikey may have a point but you see someone w/ a knife especially when it's 1 person w/ a knife against 2 that could overpower said person then yeah.,0

"@Michael Merrell "" If you have no network signal, call 911 for help. This emergency call will transmit to the closest network tower to you, giving rescuers an idea of where you are located. No signal is emitted from your phone if it is turned off or dead.""

"@TrangleC A small person with a knife can do a lot of damage. And it takes a lot for most people to flip that switch from peaceful to violent. Not saying that a lot of movies don't stretch these factors a bit too far, but I think most people overestimate how well they'd do in a similar situation. Also, on the other end of the spectrum from big hulking monsters are the bad guys that no one finds threatening; the ones that get the audience yelling at the screen, telling the protagonists not to trust/follow/turn their backs/etc. but they're going to because they have no reason to fear this unthreatening person (that might or might not have a few bodies in their crawlspace).",0

@TrangleC yeah i was wondering about this too thought its some sort of parody about gen z not being able to do anything and getting wreck by tiny feminist but yeah makes no sense and it wont be scary at all,1
"@KacUrman I don't even want to make this some political thing about Feminism and I don't care about comic book super hero movies where people with fantastical, unrealistic super powers fight each other.
It just is ridiculous to make a movie where the whole plot stands and falls with the audience having to believe that this tiny woman is so incredibly scary and powerful that a couple would act like two little, scared children around her, even when she doesn't have a weapon, or only a knife.

Every normal human being would have picked up a tree branch and beaten the little murder dork to death with it the second she started stabbing her first victim.
Punch her in the face properly or kick her in the stomach and see how scary and dangerous she is afterwards.

This just expects and asks for waaaaay too much suspension of disbelief.

There is a reason for why they made Jason Vorhees, Leatherface and other such killer characters huge, hulking monsters.

I am not saying women can't be scary. You need to put them into the right scenario though, something like ""Misery"" or ""The Hand That Rocks The Cradle"" or something like that, not this nonsense where she tries to bash in a door and two people, including a man who is taller, heavier and fitter than her, acting as if there is a Resident Evil end boss monster on the other side of the door.",0
"@Non-Agglutinative Krenak I would like to point out the fact that He was holding a fire poker earlier which could have been used as fatal weapon against Rebeca when He have seen Her in the basement with His Girlfriend, It was a longer weapon which would grant Him better reach and He still decided to run away Instead.",0
"@KacUrman In comic books, Female Super heroes are not made due to Feminism, its because man loves to see women in skin tight suits. It was a product of what men wanted. Feminism is never about Female superiority it was always about equality, Female Superiority is pushed as Feminism by Man that doesn't like Feminism so they push this agenda to ensure people have the wrong understanding of Feminism and would be against it. 
Feminism is about Females being able to do the same job as Man and when they do get to do the same job to be paid the same amount. Equality in its simplest form, to be treated as an equal for the same job and activities. 
Think about this for a second, how do you get other Women to be brave and stand up to the stereotype of Women should be paid less, by empowering them, give them the strength to stand up and ask for Equality, equal pay, by telling them they are strong and capable. Then what happens when people are against this, they start the rumor that Woman is superior, that Feminism is all about Woman being Superior than man. 

This is the same technique whenever anyone talks about Gun Control uses, even when no one ever talks about taking guns away, if you say Gun Control, they say people are taking your guns away. Just do a little research and you will see that this same technique is used by so many people, whenever an issue comes up, someone would immediately use the most outrageous claim and pushing it as the Goal when the actual Goal is more simple and easier to achieve. Because when the outrageous claim is taken as the Goal, people would be against it.",0
No big man here just small man that can�t handle big stick,0

"@idek TrangleC is actually having a good point Though, The Feminism is slowly changing into something that's either supposed to place Women higher then Man and not equal to Them, Or simply affecting the Games, Movies and other kinds of Similar services to the point where It's just about making a Woman beat up Men and show That ""Women can be strong and even stronger then Man Too."" Captain Marvel is a prime example of That, It's getting truly boring and annoying on that Point, We get the Point.",0

Well ole dad decided that 25 mph was too fast in front of his house even though posted was 30. So this day he starts walking into the middle of the road every time he sees me hit the corner the first two times I just slow and pass knowing he's drunk but the third time I stop and tell him he's the Dumbest mother fucker I've ever seen in my life and he's starts telling me I'm driving to fast blah blah and I ask him what his kids are gonna do when the watch their dad walk out into traffic? They're gonna do the same thing he says no they won't then both his kids run into the street and he acts like it's proving his point ?!-!-!!?? I tied to tell him it wasn't me driving 25 that are gonna run over his stupid ass kids but a 16 yo that's just learning and hot rodding. Then one of the drunk dads walks off the porch and is like ""wanna fight!?"" And I start cracking up and say yqll are the worst parents I've ever seen. Anyway I got to have an 8 yo and a 13 yo literally run infront of my car for about a week... guess what happened? If you guessed the 13 yo got hit by a truck and wasn't gonna ever walk again so at 15 he blew his brains out you're right. Worst parents ever. Probably loaded the gun for him",0
"@John Clark the killer didn�t have the keys until after they left them inside the vehicle. They should�ve just driven off. 
My family had a trip a long time ago where the hosts met us on the road and wanted to show us something before we left and my dad was all �maybe next time, we gotta hit the road, want to beat any traffic. Thank you guys, kids had a blast!!� And dipped tf out of there. I remember my mom was kinda mad bc they were standing in the middle of the road at first so when they got to the window their dog was kinda closer to the car, but my dad was like
�well, don�t stand in the middle of the f***ing road when there�s a car coming.�
He�s just the kinda guy who would refuse to talk to people if he didn�t have to/planned to/didn�t know who you were. Even if we were lost(before everyone had GPS on their phones/cars) he�d rather pull out a map than ask for for directions.
The owners of the place probably weren�t planning to murder us but who really knows? 
Really, My dad just had to take a dump and we were heading to into the town for breakfast before hitting the road. The agreements for the place had a specific time we had to had to be out of there by, so once we were leaving, we were leaving. 
They seemed like nice folks. I can�t think of anything on the property that would�ve been cool enough to show us that we hadn�t have discovered ourselves as 3 kids running around, playing, etc.",0
"@MAAD TEE they left the keys in the ignition. The murderer grabbed them because she did think they were heading to the car. That�s how she got the keys while the couple had time to try the police button and hangout before seeing her appear with the keys�
She didn�t have the keys before she wanted to show them one last surprise, because she needed to convince them to follow her into the woods with the camera to record the preplanned prank, _then_ they find out she�s a killer.
In all likelihood they left the keys in the car as they assumed it be a quick trip as that was what their _host_ said.",0

Go slow enough to observe any potential traps but don't stop moving towards civilization. Obviously this is when there's not a vehicle.

"There was this super gay guy at high school, girls hung out with him
My logic was �huh if i talk gay, girls will hang out with me?�
Talked gay for a few weeks. Didnt work. (Over a decade later im pretty much monotonic straight acting)
Awkward embarrassing story time: sisters friend comes over (she�s hot) i open the door and froze, coz ya know she was hot. Couldn�t talk, but when i did i just said the gayest longest loudest �ewwwwww�. 
Went through the phase of �what am i?� at 19+
Found out im demisexual.
First love, still love him in my heart. Never done any �adult� stuff with a female. I dont really care, �adult stuff� isnt for me.",0
Why are gay???,0
"Oh, this ""younger"" generation. Is anyone in this video over 19?!?!?!?!",0

"I remember coming out at 10 to my mom but I always felt like I needed to suppress it, so until this year, I had been holding it in and it wasn't like I was scared but I felt like if I told my family they'd look at me weird. Well, I came out last week as pan and my family was so accepting and even though the older ones didn't know what pan meant, they looked it up and just kept reassuring me that they loved me, and it was honestly amazing. I'm so glad I came out when I did because it allowed me time to truly figure out me :)",0

"I would say around 2 or 3, closer to 2. over quarantine I identified as bi but being with guys just doesn't feel right, and now I'm like 95% sure im straight. I notice when a guy is good looking, I can notice and admit that no problem, but I don't feel attraction. if the definition of ""gay"" is more stereotypical I would say 3 or 4. I like to think that i'm pretty masculine, but I have a few feminine traits",0
"I'd say a 2 because Ryan Reynolds
Me: YES. 
Also, I would definitely kiss Gal Gadot or Scarlett Johansson

"This is one of the things I like about zoomers. They don't have the ridiculous hang-ups my generation did. I grew up in the late 90s/early 2000s and we never could've been open with any of this shit without being shamed or called every homophobic name in the book. At the time, I thought we were a pretty sex-positive and open-minded generation, and in some aspects we were, but not as much as we should've been. We were primarily raised by boomers, so that should tell you something lol.",0

1:31 frrr,0
"Guy at 1:03 ""I'm not against it, I still need to maybe try to explore my sexuality and see what I like"" Honestly It was kinda awesome seeing a guy be honest and comfortable in himself to admit that sexuality is a spectrum and he's still figuring himself out. Same with the kid at 1:43 like try going on a date with a guy you find attractive or something and hold their hand and see what's up. Don't limit yourself to one gender if something feels right <U+0001F60E>",0
"(Male) I�ve been asking myself questions recently, I don�t know if I�m scared of being lgbt or not 
If you�re a boy and I�m attracted, you immediately out rank all girls but I don�t like masculinity. Cute boys, most twinks and femboys are all top scale and most the girls are alright too. I do like a good male genitalia and some features like deep voice, slightly muscular chest, etc. Im not bi, right? Am I just scared to be? I feel like if I were to be I would feel guilty. I know labels are useless but im relatively comfortable with whatever and just curious.",0

Always room for gay improvement 10l%,0
"I always thought I was straight, but lately I'm getting more and more bicurious. But here's where I doubt myself. I don't get if I like women because I like women, or because I live in a society which always tells me how likable, perfect and beautiful women are. Am I actually attracted to women or do I feel I should be attracted to women because that's what's suggested to me in a women's bodys over sexualizing men dominated world?",0
2:04 what a king,0
all athletes can agree that were all at least a 7 or 8,0
When it comes to my feelings I�m 10/10 gay but when it comes to physical and sexual attraction I would say 5/10 because the older I get I find myself being physically attracted to women but I just know I wouldn�t be able to fall in love with a women so I don�t know where on the scale that would make me.,0

"I love this. I'm in my 40s and straight (although like many in this video have said, I don't think anyone is 100%, so maybe I'm 1.5 or 2). But, I must say I LOVE LOVE LOVE these people.

The very last person is definitely me. I LOVE THEM. LMAO.,0
"Interesting. I�m straight, but the thought of like cuddling with another woman doesn�t make me feel uncomfortable at all and I think it�s very interesting to learn about different sexualities and identities.",0
The amount of people who said they were unlabeled was reassuring� I always sort of feel pressured to decide and to label myself even though I just don�t know yet but seeing people my age be content with not knowing felt good.,0

THE SCALED AND ICY SHIRT OMG,0
Still don't understand this Ryan reynold things <U+0001F615>,0
I find it very attractive when guys are comfortable saying that they are not completely straight and would be open to exploring their sexuality. Like yassssss I love it when guys aren�t afraid that they won�t be seen as �manly enough� and are just themselves.,0

"I thought I was straight until I dated a guy� I couldn�t kiss him, talk to him, do anything the other girls did with their boyfriends. I thought the reason I felt so uncomfortable and grossed out was because I wasn�t ready. But then I had this female friend, and the ways she would touch me, look at me, and even the times we would come just that close to kissing. I wanted to kiss her, I wanted to break the bond of friendship we had� yeah� apparently I�m not very straight� oops",0
"sexuality is always an interesting topic to discuss. for me personally, i don�t believe in hetero/homosexuality, in the sense that i don�t believe in exclusivity. i believe as human beings and by human nature, we are all naturally able to fall in love or have feelings for a male or female. am i saying we�re all bisexual? no, but i think romantically/sexually fluid would maybe best fit. i feel like religion/society plays a role in why we feel like we can�t cross those boundaries when it comes to sexuality.",0

0:51 who is this man? i love his hair,0
I can relate to the Billie Eilish one <U+0001F62C>,0
I love the ace representation,0
It�d be cool to see this with older age groups too. The vibes here were cute.,0
I'm definitely a 10,0
1:02 is really kinda refreshing. i love that our society is at a point where a straight man can recognize that exploration doesn�t define who he is yet. he gets to decide that. and as a cis man that�s powerful when most straight men feel boxed in or scared to consider anything else,0
HAHA YES MEN RULE !!!,0
I want the ace kids to know I'm so proud of them and happy for them. When I was their age i was still having boyfriends tell me they would fix me through sex and it's memories like that that will stick with me forever. Keep your head up and your heart full of love for yourself.,0
"The guy at 2:01 is the best.
""I'd say I'm at like a 3."" 
8 seconds later: ""Maybe I am gay, I don't know.""",0

0:59 as a gay guy.... I'm sorry no... there are people that are just completely straight. just as how there are people that are completely gay.,0
we all know 0:30 is lying right?,0
The fact that the commercial I got before this was a Ryan Reynolds commercial,0
Who the dude in the thumbnail I loved his answer,0
"Im part of genZ too (21yo) but it makes me happy that these young kids understand the idea of spectrum and fluidity thus they could respect others better.

Love is love",0
me and the last kid would be great friends. next level!!!!!!!!!!,0
these 2s need one night with daddy!,1
no its not. you either gay or you not. its not a spectrum. im 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000% into men. a dude who likes dudes,0
"I agree with the ""everybody is a little gay"". I myself am straight and only think about men in a romantic and/or sexual way but i don't close the door on the possibility that maybe a girl one day could create a spark in me for some reason.",0
Ok the girl at 2:32 can hmu!,0
;-),0
Loved the ace representation,0
"""Everyone is a little gay"" - Pretty sure the same idea of ""everyone is a little straight"" is what has lead countless gay people to either hate themselves or be societally shunned for not being able to ""make it work"" with the opposite sex. I mean, if ""everyone is a little gay"" and ""everyone is a little straight"" and ""no one is completely straight"" and ""no one is completely gay"", then everyone is bisexual and has the capacity to ""make it work"" with either sex, no? This whole idea is so toxic, misleading, untrue, and annoying. I'm a male who's exclusively attracted to other males; it's possible. Any person not exclusively attracted to the opposite sex is not straight and any person not exclusively attracted to the same sex is not gay. It's really not complicated.",0
"Why do straight guys like Ryan Reynolds so much? As a straight woman, I don�t think he�s attractive at all",0
I'm a 10 but I can still appreciate an attractive woman. Like I'm not attracted to her sexually but I know she's attractive according to our beauty standards. So then reverse that for straight guys who think they might be a little gay just because they can appreciate a good looking dude.,0
I feel like y'all kidnapped a highschool and did this video. They barely look old enough to drive.,0

"let's see how many of them give a straight answer ;)


sorry, bisexuality comes with bad jokes",0
"4:40 10 is for like normal gays, I'm like next level"" 
yeah same lmao",0
"You can base your sexuality on only what you like, but you should also keep in mind what is around you.
The spectrum of sexuality is even more complex than we think, because it's 100% conditioned by our lives circumstances. 
For example, you can like someone a lot, but you can just not have a chance to be with that person. 
So, what you like matters, but things really depend on who you can actually be with (from the people you like, obviously. Don't force yourself to be with someone you're not attracted to).",0
Yay thank you for including asexuals!!!!,0
seeing how many people are not only respectful ofc but also comfortable exploring their own sexuality is very refreshing and wholesome <U+0001F97A><U+0001F497> don�t be afraid to find your true self!,0

Theyre so open about it and thats so great to see! My school, there was only one open lesbian and everyone just knew her as ""the weird lesbian"" which was so fucked up lmfao <U+0001F62D>

"Really interesting to see that not a single guy identified as gay, and only a couple anywhere around the 4/10 or 5/10 mark. Still think there's a real stigma around the image of what a ""gay man"" or a ""bisexual man"" is, and there's so much pressure on young men to fit the patriarchal norm. As much as sexism is still a hugely prevalent and insidious issue for girls, i do think the way the patriarchal system has okayed bisexuality for girls has taken the pressure off exploring our identities a little bit. Or maybe girls just know themselves better at a younger age \_(- -)_/
I'd be really interested to see what all of these people say 5 or 10 years down the line.",0
"Well where is the �How straight am I� video, because I�m going to say 10 about my straightness instead of me being in a video where I need to say I am zero. Not fair. You�re essentially making it seem like being gay is being better than straight, you�re forcing people to say that they are zero or one or two makes then feel less than the people who are not going by natures path. I respect everyone�s decisions but content like this makes me question this whole platform. 90% + people are 100% straight. So give us content that the people really want CUT.",0

"@Bee Alyse I can see where you�re coming from.

Hope you have a good day.",0
@Bee Alyse I know people who�s really simply Ace and still identify as LGBTQ+. Of course you can have your own view but I don�t think you should just exclude them with such finality <U+0001F937><U+0001F3FC><U+200D><U+2640><U+FE0F>,0
"@Julia People of different sexual orientations and gender identities can be asexual. So you're telling me if a straight person is asexual, they can decide to be part of the LGBTQ community? That is entirely incorrect my friend. I am all for welcoming Ace folk into the community when they are lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer, questioning, and/or intersex. Not every Ace person is LGBTQ whether they want to be or not <U+0001F937><U+0001F3FE><U+200D><U+2640><U+FE0F> The A in the acronym is questionable in itself. Allys are not LGBTQ. Ace folk are not LGBTQ by default. 

We have definitions for a reason. While sexuality and gender absolutely exist on a spectrum, there are still hard lines at either end. You're straight. You're gay or lesbian. Or you fall somewhere in between. You're cis. You're trans. You're neither. Or you fall somewhere in between. Claiming otherwise invalidates the experience of others.",0
"@Bee Alyse Actually, it's in the plus you left off. LGBTQIA; A stands for asexual. Ultimately it's up to the asexual person if they identify as part of the LGBTQ+ community or not. I wouldn't make a blanket statement like that, excluding people who do want to belong in the community when there are many people who do.",0
"@Julia I must have missed that so thanks for pointing it out. On the contrary the video is also titled ""How Gay Are You"". Perhaps editing should have been handled differently as more than one person answered that they were Ace...in a video asking how gay they were. To answer your question, what I'm trying to do is clarify that being asexual doesn't make you LGBTQ.",0
"They also asked ""How would you describe your sexuality."" Even if that was her answer to the first question it still relates... don't know what you're trying to do there",0
"@Mike Goodwalk commenting shit like �how could you say Ryan Reynolds and Brad Pitt are plain??! They�re literal perfection!!

You�re delusional if you think that�s what �asking questions� looks like. But if you really want to know how someone couldn�t be attracted to them, the answer is pretty simple: some people just have different tastes. What a complete mindfuck, right? That people might experience attraction outside of the robotically systematic metric you�ve invented? The only one having a hard time here is you. Come out of the closet already, bro.",1

@Cajejsks Caksls That's exactly what I'm saying... They will get hated on for being straight if they don't prostrate themselves before the church of LGBT.,0
"@Mike Goodwalk not really� they�re just straight simple as that, why would they feel uncomfortable? it�s not like they�re gonna get hated for being straight",0
"@0zan OG I'm not saying you kids are like ""FORCED TO BE GAY!!!!"", but there is a legitimate fear of being labeled as anti-LGBT",1
@Mike Goodwalk feel you man peer pressure,0
"@Shaun This only goes one way here, dude... We explore straight people's sexuality only",1
@Shaun How dare you! That's conversion therapy!!!!!,0
"Doesn't anyone detect the discomfort that these kids have in just saying they're straight without adding any qualifiers, or outright refusing to label themselves altogether?",0
Gay men need to explore their sexuality.,0
"Yes! Back when I was in high school 15+ years ago, guys couldn�t even compliment a dudes shirt without having his sexuality questioned. This calmness and comfortability is humbling!",0
@Neez Dutz ngl Im thinking the same,0
@Ignacio Sabljak cuz i like to hurt peoples feelings,1
@Neez Dutz im dead.. i mean whats the point of debunking whether they shed a tear while typing smth or not <U+0001F480>,1

@Neez Dutz why you gotta say that,0

your username and profile picture made me choke on the spaghetti i was eating,1
"@Krystal Morales I think most people have a somewhat clear answer to that, no?",0
"@Krystal Morales I interpreted the question as �when was the first time you were sexually attracted to someone�, it doesn�t question how straight someone is imo.",0
"@Narcis people get mad when you question how straight they are, no one specific in this video obviously but I know some people who would definitely get a bit bothered by it. I personally think it's fucked how we ask this to everyone on the LGBTQ+ spectrum but God forbid you ask a straight person if they are sure lol",0
@MikeHawk69 who gets mad,0
"It�s just a simple plain question, I don�t know why people get mad",0
Love this question.,0
"Tau wolke Unfortunately, my iPhone won�t let me see your entire comment. I�m assuming you�re questioning my �right� to say what I did. On that assumption I�ll say I have the �right� to voice any opinion I want to, even if my opinion doesn�t meet with someone�s approval.

I agree that one might not know one�s sexuality at 18 � or at 50, etc.",0
"to know at only 18 that you are straight is even more premature. I mean you most likely haven't tried the same gender out right?? 

Like who gives you the right to tell someone who they should like, who they don't or if they even like someone at all. You don't know how someone else feels and if they think with under 18 years that they are asexual then they are. If it changes (because sexuality is fluid) they will change labels afterwards, but most people know their sexuality from a young age. There's no difference if they are gay, bi, pan, ace or whatever.

So please shut up and let people be who they wanna be, it doesn't matter how old they actually are.",0
"@Merle if there is a chance that you CAN like anyone no matter the gender, the idk where ur standards are. Not saying you are going to like anyone like you said, but then there is not a chance that you CAN like anyone. But i guess what you are saying is that it don't matter gender, which i didn't disagree with",0
"@Matthew yeah you�re missing the point. i personally identify as bi but i also like every gender, that doesn�t mean i want to be in a relationship with every person i meet (i still have a type and standards obviously) but that i can develop crushes on boys, girls and any other gender.",0
"@Merle to be able to like anyone? Idk, for me it's a weird thought. It feels a bit like I'm back in kindergarten where Im 5 and I'm friend with anyone, even with the people that annoys me",0
@Matthew how is that weird though?<U+0001F928>,0
"@Merle i didn't say anything about falling in love, but it's a bit absurd to say that you CAN like anyone whatever their gender.",0
"@Matthew thats not what they mean though? pansexuality means you CAN like anyone regardless of gender, not that you�re in love with every person you meet",0
"@3lement2010 cause you can't like ""anyone"", i get that the attraction can be more than just sexual for some people, but that doesn't imply that you can like anyone, because you like them for their personality",0
How is it dumb though? Not trying to sound aggressive towards you. I'm just genuinely curious.,0
@Chazzie Grosshandler if you're 100% straight you're ignorant?,1
@Margherita that they just be ignorant abt it.,0
Whats closed minded about saying youre straight,0
My aesthetic attraction towards the opposite was strong in my teens and twenty�s but now I�ve found while I�m still ace I�m aesthetically attracted to women more and more,0
@Azraus I don't think so... Like I'm not entirely sure what romantic attraction is at the best of times. But I've only had crushes on women.,0
Is it because acceptance to the scenario where you could be attracted to or...?,0
when asked if I�m straight I respond that I�m heteroromantic and leave it at that,0
@Jamiroquae VDS ah ok I appreciate it dawg,0
"@WireReady it means that they don't really feel any kind of sexual attraction (or at least less than the average person). so while they can still fall in love with another person, they don't desire them sexually and their attraction to that person is not based on anything inherently sexual (i.e. physical attributes related to sexuality). it differs per person but for some the idea of sex is absolutely disgusting whereas for others it's just not very exciting and almost more like just something they would do for the other person but not necessarily for themselves.",0
What is A sexual? Can you break it down? First time hearing of it,0
"another ace here, i'd just say gay cause it's the easiest lol",0
The two go hand in hand my guy. Hope you come to understand better,0
My question is how are you finding a correlation between driving a metal box and getting jiggy with the same gender??,0
You didn�t know at their age? I sure did,0
We love to see it,0
So happy to see it,0
"Yes, sadly that is true",0
sadly it's true,0
Thats... so true,0
@Corey Sturgeon it�s objectively attractive men not we that we find them attractive if that makes sense. Like I can�t sit here and say Chris brown is ugly like he�s just objectively not doesn�t mean that I lustly look at him if he were to walk by the same way I would if a girl walked by because I don�t find men attractive if that makes sense? Haha,0
Yes. People always assume if they find someone of the same sex attractive that means they�re gay but it�s not. As a gay person myself I can tell you when women are attractive. But I�m not sexually attracted to them. Just find them attractive lol. If people say they don�t find any man attractive they�re either ace or closeted af because they don�t want to admit any man can be attractive.,0
@Cim but who cares tho?,1
"@Neez Dutz I appear to be sensitive? They are questioning their sexuality as if it's not a real thing. Flip that around for someone saying they are a 10, and ask yourself if you're okay with that?",0
They just not gay sorry you dont like their answer. They didnt say it in a disrespectful way your just taking it like that cuz you appear to be to sensitive.,0

Did he play a movie with Sandra Bullock? I know he played Deadpool tho. If yes, then yes I'm straight but holy I find him attractive in that movie. That's just a charisma maybe.",0
@tiwtfb not insecure at all. Just voicing an opinion that matters to me. CUT needs to curate to the people and not a specific group. Social engineering at its finest. If you can�t see it I�m sorry but at least my opinion is expressed.,0

How insecure do you have to be to be hurt by this video? <U+0001F644>,1
Because sexuality is a topic that should be discussed more. The reason why it takes gay people years to find out is because they aren't allow to discuss their sexuality.,0
@HATSUNE MIKU666 oh honey� you�re saying word for word what I�ve heard from so� so many trans women� especially trans lesbians. �I don�t want to be trans� I just wish I was born a girl� is VERY commonly repeated. Let me tell you right now: no matter how old you are� no matter how you look right now� you can ALWAYS transition and be the woman you wish you could be. Science has come a long� long way: hormones work wonders. Wishing you all the best� darling <U+0001F497>,0
@who even you said this perfectly,0
@Mike Goodwalk nice to see you here,0
Because they're scared to just say they're straight without qualifications...,0
Not true bruv,0
�I think everyone is a little straight�,0
"@HATSUNE MIKU666 wishing to be born as a different sex than the one assigned at birth is a pretty good indicator of maybe being trans. i know it can be so hard to truly allow ourselves to be ourselves and go follow our needs, feelings, wants etc, especially since being any form of queer often comes with hardships and discrimination in our society. wether or not you are trans, I hope that you find whatever makes you happiest. there is a whole community out there full of people who are queer and would welcome you with open arms, if you were. the way you speak about lesbianism is very sweet and doesn't sound like an outsiders look of oversexualisation, more like a genuine wish to live like that.... you seem quite open talking about this, so I hope you can also be open with yourself, trans or not :) and remember you don't have to have anything figured out, everyone is growing and on a journey and there is no right or wrong. all the best to you! <3",0
@Wooyoung's woobies yeah but i'm definitely both sexually and romantically attracted to women. I don't see ur point,0
@HATSUNE MIKU666 nah cause there�s gorgeous men who are literal models and it makes me wonder how men are straight,0
"@HATSUNE MIKU666 You can be only romantically attracted to one gender and sexually to another. No need to hop that dick or pussy just because the word ""gay/straight"" exists.",1
"@who even thank you. I have practically wished to be a girl my entire life and have cried once or twice because of it when I was 11 but I don't wish to be trans it's normal to want to be the opposite sex from time to time. Also I just relate to lesbian content more partially because it's hot but it so feels more comfortable and right to me, it's like the purest form of love possible. Sometimes i imagine myself dating my old crush as a girl, just feels better and it's hotter. I know I sound kind of trans when I say this but I definitely don't want to become a woman, I just wish I was born as one. now I'm feeling empty again",0
@KJ Freeman he is,0
Nahhh� that�s not it. Bisexuality is its own distinct� beautiful experience� and plenty of people are 100% straight. Claiming otherwise just makes it harder to talk about gay/bi experiences.,0
"@HATSUNE MIKU666 absolutely dont want to tell you who you are, but maybe it could help you to look a bit into what being trans feminine or nonbinary is. it sounds like you might have dysphoria :) but either way I wish you well!! we are all just growing into who we are and that journey can take different shapes and forms along the way.",0
"I'm a guy and am absolutely not gay not even a little bit. Sometimes I wish I could be a lesbian because I don't like looking at my own dick, also I'm surprised straight girls even exist I don't see what they see in guys like me but I'm glad they do exist",0
"No, I am not at all. I have no problem at all with gay folks, never have since a teen. It just isn't me.",0

"@choblgobblrr First off, I did address them. You just didn't like the reply because you only want to hear your own beliefs regurgitated. Secondly, if you're looking for well rounded answers on YT then forget about it with this topic because they delete whatever grinds their gears. Thirdly, if you don't wish for your words to be misconstrued then I would advise that you use them more carefully next time. Fourthly, you did make a claim about Christians being homophobic and as I'm Orthodox that means me; it's incredible how you weasel around owning up to what you've said.

I named several books in the OT & NT but your ignorance on this topic only permits you to call others a bigot. Have fun in life demanding others agree with you, you're in for a rough ride if you can't learn to agree to disagree. Remember, disagreeing with someone doesn't I hate, mistreat, or fear them...it just means I disagree and move on! Toodles<U+0001F618>",1
"@missnthrop 1) Don�t know why you can�t address any of my comments in their entirety, and why you have to address only small portions of my comments that without context do nothing for this conversation. 2) Beastiality and incest have nothing to do with what we are talking about so why bring it up, same thing for the Quran. 3) I reiterated my stance on opinion over facts, and I originally made the comment for your benefit. Attempting to use that against me is, again, far more telling than you intend it to be. 4) Being gay is part of a person, just as much as being straight is (and I never claimed you were homophobic, though you assuming I did is�ironic to say the least. But, I digress) so saying you dislike/disagree with a fundamental part of a persons existence doesn�t help your case at all. 

Anyways, goodnight. This argument has been entirely in vain. Have fun being bigoted I guess (and this time I am implying it, bc no one spends this much time arguing over the most minimal teachings of the Bible in the absence of context and in such a confined manner unless they have an agenda of homophobia).",1
"@choblgobblrr But it does, go read Cor/Lev/Deut/Exod/etc which also mention being against beastiality and incest. I can't do your homework for you, read the Bible cover to cover and find out for yourself much like I did the same when I read the Quran cover to cover so that I could better understand that faith. Now, I don't expect someone who thinks that opinions supercede facts to know this BUT phobia is the Greek work for fear & to disagree with someone of ANY sexual identity is just that, a disagreement. It doesn't mean I fear the person so please don't project your emotions onto me <U+270C>",0
"@missnthrop I�m not really expecting you to stop commenting, if you genuinely believe that you�re more asinine than you already make yourself out to be. And secondly, read *why* I said you should be quiet. You�re incredibly hypocritical in ALL your points

I also wouldn�t bring up sensitivity when you moan and groan at the mere mention of backlash to Christianity. Again, form better arguments or don�t make any at all.

��and I wont�t call you a hypocrite� You�re not in much of a position to be calling anyone a hypocrite.",0
"@missnthrop I made that comment perhaps to blunt the point I was trying to make. But you are very right, opinions don�t supersede facts. That is why people shouldn�t use the Bible to justify their homophobia. Both because the Bible never says being gay is a sin, and because the actions that many Christians take while being homophobic are antithetical to the teachings of Christ. It�s rather convenient that of ALL tenets of Christianity (and most abrahamic religions) Christians choose to focus on this very small, misinterpreted portion of the Bible. That in itself IS factually not in accordance with the teachings of the Bible. If you�re going to argue based on objectivity.",0
@akilegna As long as you accept that that's a two way street because everyone's a POS these days<U+0001F923><U+0001F923>,0
"@choblgobblrr I can bring up whatever I'd like, free speech isn't just for you toots. Don't like what I have to say? Then ignore me but I'm not going to censor myself to placate your sensitivity.",1
"@choblgobblrr When does an opinion supercede a fact? When you like the one that feeds your bias? What a ludicrous comment, opinions are never superceded by facts. It's vice versa & you've clearly either never read the Bible or you're reading the progressive Christianity interpretation to feed your desired narrative.",1
"@CDH What does you claiming to be a Christian have to do with anything? St. Nick slapped Arius for a reason. Did I say I don't like gay people? No. I can disagree with someone's lifestyle (just like I disagree with heterosexual sex before marriage) without hating someone. Hate the sin, love the sinner <U+2626>",0

@lynx Only immature ones,1
"I didn't realize I was bi until I was nearly 21. I'd recently gotten out of a 4 year relationship when I realized, so I might have suppressed it longer than I would have.",0
PLSS,0
@HATSUNE MIKU666 my husband is more comfortable with female friends but he's very straight. It's not as uncommon as people think.,0
"@TheAnonymousGamerHD this is so similar to my journey. Except I'm almost 27 and not out yet, and unsure of my label. I'm proud and happy for you! <U+2764><U+0001F308> but isn't it crazy how there can be so many signs from a young age, but we would give any other explanation to those signs other than, that we liked women?",0
True. There were already signs that I also liked women when I was younger but never really put much thought about it. I considered myself straight until I was 21. And only when I turned 23 last year I came out as bisexual.,0
A lot of these are college students,0
@HATSUNE MIKU666 I love this!! I'm so happy you discovered yourself and are comfortable in who you are! Men that are confident enough in their sexuality to be effeminate and be themselves are so sexy. It's crazy that because of social and gender norms we have to assume things about ourselves just because of our personality traits or because of what society says we should be/are. Keep doing you!! <U+2764>,0
or after college,0
@HATSUNE MIKU666 I just KNOW you�re in for a great dating life� lots of girls really dig guys who can �get� them and who are willing to play a little dress-up haha,0
@mondler&bechloe94 it's weird because the exact opposite happened to me as a guy. I always assumed I was gay my whole life just because I was effeminate and liked to hang out with girls more than guys so I just went by the label gay but turns out I'm only attracted to women and it was a big realization for me weirdly enough,0
i thought the exact same thing haha,0
"THIS ^ because as a teen I thought I was straight. I finally realized I liked women when I was like 21ish. I identified as bi for many years, and in the past year or two I've realized I like women way more than men, and at almost 27 I don't wanna label myself as lesbian, bi or pan, so I just say I'm super gay (level 22 perhaps like that last guy <U+0001F602>) and never in a million years would I have known I'd be this person as a teenager. I thought I was a god damn ally <U+0001F602> sexuality can be ever fluctuating, or you can meet the right person/people that make your feelings change; or as a teenager you are maybe not in the right environment for you to realize your true self. And I'm not saying this is the case for all, many of these people will still identify as straight in 5 years, but I bet many will not and even people that said they were in the LGBTQ+ community already may have switched labels or realized new things about themselves. I would LOVE to see this!!",0

"@Janet 

""Masculinity�(also called�manhood�or�manliness) is a set of attributes,�behaviors, and roles associated with�men�and�boys.""
-so both men and women can be masculine

""Femininity�(also called�womanliness�or�girlishness) is a set of attributes, behaviors, and roles generally associated with�women�and�girls.�""
-so both men and women can be feminine

""Toxic means extremely harsh, malicious, or harmful. For example; toxic sarcasm""
-both men and women can be toxic

We label toxic masculinity only to men because being toxic masculine generally means ""men following gender norms and making it worse"". For example not being hygenic because ""it is not manly, cleaning up is for females"" is being toxic masculine. Calling other men gay because they're being feminine is being toxic masculine. Raping and beating up women is being toxic masculine. Toxic masculine people see these things as being manly.

And yes, women can be masculine too but they cannot be toxic masculine because females being masculine is not really a gender norm, nor it is accepted in manly men. I never saw any women saying stuff like ""wiping ass is for women"" even if they're masculine.
There's this thing called ""toxic feminine"" though.

"@Janet both are not delusions. What the fuck are you talking about.
Edit if you didnt understand this simple thing; by ""it doesn't have anything to do with their gender"" i meant even if someone has shitty opinions that does not mean everyone with their gender has the same opinion. So there is no reason why someone would say ""women detected opinion rejected"", all women dont think that way. 
Aand toxic masculinity is not generalising all men. Women can be misogynistic too so it can not be generalising men neither. But saying ""women detected opinion rejected"" is generalising. It literally says that women opinion dont matter.",1

@Big Dibber nick yes it is definitely evolution that created male and female /s,0
"This comment section is a cesspool lmao (although at this point thats the standard). Triggered incels and triggered waman not realizing how they sound exactly the same.
No my dudes, women dont just need a ""30 min work out to look hot"" nor do men need ""insane amounts of work to build even a little muscle"". Stop with the gross exaggerations.
The fact of the matter is that regardless of your gender, the amount of work you need boils down to genetics. 
Some poeple build muscle almost on automatic, we call that ""amazing genetics"". 
Some people put in an insane amount of hours at the gym and barely see results: shitty genetics.
Now, women produce a tiny percentage of the amount of testosterone a man produces. 
But that doesnt mean women need to work out less wtf? The absense of the single most anabolic hormone naturally found in the human body means they need to work out MORE not less. That coupled with the fact that estrogen binds with fat, and you get the obvious:
Sexual dimorphism is a thing.
Its almost like men and women have millions of years of divergent evolutionary development that makes our bodies lean towards diferent areas.
And we will invariably see those genetic evolutionary differences manifest in the body.
But heres the key: diferent doesnt mean worse. Thats the most asinine and cancerous bs to stem out of shitty gender ideologies. 
Its not a competition, men and women are not at odds with each other. Our diferences are complementary, not confilcting.
So stop trying to use whatever is between your legs to victimize yourselves. Its pathetic.",1

As an arab muslim guy I�ll give some free tips btw I don�t represent my religion because i far away from that beautiful religion anyway if i married a girl and most arabs has my mindset pretty much she will not have a boy friend or hangout with boys except me and I�ll do the same if she wants she will not wear anything that show her body because she is my wife i get jealous so fast and if she doesn�t want and she want to wear whatever she wants I�ll fight with everyone who look at her body i will pay the bills everything she doesn�t need to do nothing just cook for me and I�ll give her money to do whatever she wants she will live like queen if she�s working she i will not take anything from her her money it belongs to her to do whatever she wants like i said I�ll pay anything she want and still I�m gonna give her some money because women is everything we need to take care of them I�ll do the best to take care of my family family is everything women should be respected because house job is very hard I really appreciate women who cook for there husbands and clean the house,0

"I am a muslim girl from Pakistan and I have this experience from a proposal I got from a prestigious rich family,my parents also used to like the guy since he is really well mannered and assumingly good looking.Long story short,basically they had everything a *Worldly* girl could ask for but I wenr for Istikhara and I got a vague dream about entering a cave with red lights and monsters shadows (excuse me I am still youngg so yeah I am full of childish fantasies).But I think I forgot about it and sometime later my parents start to persuade me to give an answer while dangerously being in favour of proposal(I m pretty sure they would be heartbroke if i would hv said no) .For a week or so i was really stressed and one day out of nowhere 3 conditions popped into my head while performing my prayer Namaz
1.I wanted my spouse to perform 5 times prayers,atleast the farz prayer s since thr is a Hadith of Prophet Mohammad pbuh that ""The difference between a believer(Muslim) and unbeliever(Mushrik) is that of Namaz"", and I dont want to marry a non-Muslim obv
2.I want my spouse to earn and feed me Halal bcoz a hadith states that on eating one morsel of haram a person's prayer isnt accepted for 40 days.. since that person was in media related industry which make use of photograpy(modelling industry) and music both of which are haram (according to hadith) obviously his earning would be haram too.I couldnt hv married him while he pursue this medium of earning (the Muslim scholars, the guy's family got in touch with for confirming my theory ,accepted that I am right Alhamdullillah)
3.I want him to do Tauba on his premarital affairs he had (We knew he had a gf once before ) coz there is a quranic verse telling Muslim and Muslimahs to not marry fornicators(Zani,one who had done zina) bcoz these can only marry to other fornicators or non-Muslims until they ask Allah for forgiveness about it
-Correspondingly I will advise you to get in touch with ur Allah to know what decision to make and just keep praying since I believe we Muslims can also get lowkey revelations from our Allah when we connect to him (Not claiming Prophethood Nauzubillah ) but He actually helps,u just hv to be patient and steadfast.My father is much proud of me now and not in the least bit heartbroken that the propossl is kinda refused by me and I am loving it.The guy's mother refused to change his mode of earning this abruptly but they did understood my point of view Alhamdullillah,May Allah give them Hidayah .Hope my experience helps and if anyone one wants the quranic verse or hadith reference feel free to get in touch or just search google regarding themm

"Hello Daniela, If I can make a little suggestion, you know when you edit your videos? 

I know many do it, they keep cutting that breathing space but in doing so, you don't actually give the natural breathing space for the brain to process the information, if that makes sense.

So what humans have a tendency to do, is after a while they just switch off, even if they continue to watch, but very little or nothing will be registered, as human beings we need pauses in order to digest ""X"" amount of information at one time. 

The same applies to written text, space are essential, or people will be put off if the text is not separated into smaller paragraphs.

So, speak and take pauses in between, thanks and by the way I love your videos, and I hope you don't take it the wrong way.
All the best (It's just a small advice not a criticism)",0
"i agree you cannot live off love,besides what most people deem love is not maintainable,its just phases of emotion and how we adapt to it..false pretenses for most part,perhaps that's why those who date more often break up and they complain that the relationship is not what it used to be or perhaps the flame is lost. Believe me the thrill of the chase or perhaps for some being chased is the most exciting part,well that's one of my favorite parts in a relationship at least but then of cos when the chase is over no one has to be running right...?so naturally that part will die out and yes of cos it can get a bit of revival in a form of excitement as a means of showing the relationship still has flair and your better half is still valued the same or even more now that the chase phase has come to an end.
 The reality is all these phases are unavoidable and all those phases are only best suited for a well matched marriage as people date the phases come and go and whoever it may be decides because change is not what they were betting on or at least they just don't like it they just throw in the towel for anything really be it a big issue or maybe just a issue or subject matter that was never spoken of in perhaps the first few months of a relationship but once it comes most are not ready for it. If you approached your marriage more like a business all that extra stuff will be noted and both parties would be aware of it and this entails subject matters like whats your level of Iman, where would you like to go in regards to that,do you want to improve on that,would you like to be supported on your spiritual growth. If one partner isn't too religious is that partner willing to grow and support their partner? What is your financial goal or what type of lifestyle would you like to live? How many kids(and you cant just change your mind about kids and plans it all has to progress with the partner) if these issues are addressed it pretty much covers everything you said about who not to marry. Compatibility is important,compromise and intellectual compatibility....i for one cant deal with conversations about how drunk or high someone got....i cant process things that are useless information ill give a blank answer or no answer at all likewise someone that is like that wouldn't find my interests interesting at all. anyway if you stick to the Quran and the Sunnah you wont go astray but if you try your own way of doing something as big as being with another human being you will fail and if its not failure in everything their will be something. Id rather deal with hardships Allah wills while i follow his prophets guidance than hurt myself expecting a different outcome despite the statistical facts of peoples failed relationships and marriages.",0

"Don't make a statement in a generalise manner for a particular religion only. Because whatever you said it happens and it is true, such men are there in society but it can be found in all the societies, culture, state, region, country and religion.
Actually you should say ""don't Marry such men who has these habits or way of thinking"" 
And when you pointed out first point about womanizer then there are girls and woman too in the society who loves romance, live in , free will relationship, sex so you can't generalize that as muslim woman only.
It depends on individual person (man or woman) what they like, what is their fantasy/dream/desire , how they want to live their life.

We should see what is right and wrong, we should see in a relationship an individual must get their own space, in any relationship a person should not force other person to change him or her according to there wish, in a relationship no one should force religion or any commandments on each other.
At last in relationship, if you truly love someone, there is way to express anger or dislike without being rude & disrespectful.

"As a muslim man, I think some people are kind of misinterpreting what she means by broke people.
If you don't have money to raise a wife/children, then this will cause a lot of issues.
She is not talking about a man who can rent an apartment..
she is talking about a man who has no job and lives in their mums basement.
It is not fair on a woman to have to marry such a man without full disclosure.
As long as the man is upfront (and vice versa) then it shouldnt matter.
But at the end of the day in islam, it is always promoted that people should work and not beg... the upper hand is always superior to the lower hand",0

You should ask Allah to forgive you if you�ve pushed your agenda toward younger Muslimahs that could possibly look at you as in Islamic role model. You�re clearly unlearned and immature minded. The matter in which you choose to discuss will promote more gossip and negativity rather than education. Anything and everything that you wrongfully do against Islam using this public platform and with such a high subscriber base you�ll be held accountable for with Allah.,1

Don�t be so sure of yourself that you�re a good Muslimah. You are actually a disgraceful Muslim woman. Do you think you are pretty on the outside ? You are the type Muslim men should run away from. You talk about a man going to jumuah but Allah made it obligatory for men to go for jumuah. Allah also tells men to lower their gaze and you expose yourself and expect men not to look knowingly that naturally they will. Where are you doing your part as a Muslimah? Your mentality is ugly therefore you�re unattractive.,1

Islam was the first religion to give women voting rights, the rights to work , charity in the form of benefits to help aid the poor .. You cannot use ideology of one and tar everyone with same brush!! One should look at themselves before passing judgement !!",0

Marrying someone who hasn't something for his own self is suicide ! imagine if the woman doesn't work ? double suicide ! some of you whom parents it worked well al hamdulilah for them but she isn't wrong ! we aren't demanding a billionaire shaykh but a man who shall be able to take care of his family cause THIS is sunna and also in the Qur'an,1

step one: wear the hijab.,1
Today's girls only love money. They have no concern with the husbands. The husbands sacrifice their entire lives to make their wives and children happy. They give everything they have and just look at the girls. I have never heard about any girl who loves her husband and expressed their feelings about them. They just expressed about their beauty and money. And remember girls always provoke boys to look at them and do bad things by showing their beauty by using lipstick and makeup. You talked about Islam. Islam teaches females to not show their beauty to everyone except husbands only.,0

"Unfortunately I was the guy who used to go to Jumah in the day and go to the club at night. Not because I was being an ignorant hypocrite. I was in college, and didn't have the heart to break my mom's heart...it meant everything to her that her son go to Jummah, I knew she would observe the parking lot of the masjid to look for my car to see if I came after class at 1:00 PM, I didn't want to practice Islam anymore or go to Jummah, but didn't know how to disappoint her. I think having to be a closeted Agnostic probably accelerated my desire to go to nightclubs and that type of stuff.

"Maybe if Muslim Women were better behaved and studied more and worked hard in life instead of making a video about how bad Muslim men are or making videos on social culture rather than education or bettering one self, Muslim men would take Muslim Women more seriously and wouldn�t act in a certain manner or do the things you�re accusing them of doing.",1
"Allah blesses the marriages that require the lowest cost. You don't need money to get married, it's just a cultural thing to put on big ridiculous weddings that offer next to no benefit, and offer a lot of liabilities. However, if you're going to get married to a woman, you need to have money to support her, which is mentioned in Islam (i think in the Hadith), if you don't have money to support her, then don't get married to her, unless you guys get married young and are still studying and living with parents (i believe, correct me if I'm wrong).",0

"I have a non muslim friend who slept with a hijabi muslim girl. According to her, her family have no clue about her �secret life.� 

I know of another brother who had a very hedonistic past but through the will and Mercy of Allah made him into a revert. He is now one of the most pious and disciplined Muslims I know, gave up on all of his bad habits and is now married.

The moral of the story is, being born a Muslim doesn�t necessarily mean you�re a better Muslim. It isn�t our place to judge and must always forgive and pardon others. None of us are perfect and we all make mistakes. 

Only Allah (SWT) can judge and he is the best of judges.

I agree with Dan on not marrying the broke guy. Not because they cant provide but rather broke guys can change through time. I know a lot of women who married poor men. Those men were good and would dote on thier wives. As soon as they got rich they got proud and arrogant and starting looking for other wives. I'm not saying that broke guys are entirely bad but one must be careful. Money can change a person for the worst.,0

"Yes, a woman is allowed to work as long as she is still able to fulfill her duties as a wife and mother. Islam is not a feminist religion. Children and household are primarily (but not exclusively) the womans job, even though the husband should help her. You ladies want the benefits of traditional islamic gender roles (men are supposed to take care of you, provide for you, make money etc), so you have to accept your duties as well.",1

"I was aware about all these types of ""muslim"" men, to me they're not even muslim:

1) the hoe, lots of guys from my culture/ethnicity do exactly that , hoe around and want to settle down with a proper muslim woman later in life , makes me gag. just put a ring on that hoe you've been screwing to save yourself from God's wrath. I mean I shouldn't be saying these things, maybe they were in love who knows. but if you're going to dump her like that guy did to the chick in legally blonde for someone ""better"" then you're disgusting. every woman muslim or not doesn't deserve to be with the likes of you. at the same time , you�re NOT EVEN A MUSLIM IF YOU WERE HAVING A FLING IN THE FIRST PLACE YOU DON�T DESERVE TO BE WITH A PURE HEARTED WOMAN. I HATE BOYS/MEN WHO EVEN ENTER A RELATIONSHIP WITHOUT TAKING IT SERIOUSLY AND SAY THINGS LIKE OH WE WERE ONLY 17 WE DIDNT KNOW WHAT WE WERE DOING OR JUST DO SOMETHING UNBELIEVABLE AND MAKE THE GIRL REALIZE THEY WERE NEVER IN IT FOR REAL EXCEPT TO USE YOU. I WISH I CAN SAVE EVERY WOMAN OUT THERE FROM THESE �MUSLIM� MEN. DON�T BELIEVE THEM IF THEY SAY THEYRE MUSLIM LADIES. SOMETIMES HE MIGHT SAY THAT TO IMPRESS YOU SUCH AS WHY DON�T YOU WEAR HIJAB? I WANT US BOTH TO BE DEVOTED TO EACHOTHER BUT HE BE SCREWING OTHER GIRLS ON THE SIDE. I�M NOT JOKING I�M SAYING THESE THINGS FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCES. NEVER rush into a marriage EITHER. If he is rushing you, OR if people are telling you it's haram to date, don't listen to them. don't let them TOUCH YOU control whatever urges you have cause they're STUPID SILLY AND ALL THE WORK OF SHAYTAN. do you ever wonder why was I with him in first place? cause SHAYTAN THATS WHY. you need to know who you're marrying though...so get to know him, because you don't know he might turn out to be a complete psycho after marriage, turn into haram police, try to change you whatever.� he might seem amazing at the beginning but it's a trap. he is a complete liar. so watch out. also, if he is willing to SLEEP WITH YOU before marriage and claims the imam married you both already(since neither of you virgin), or if he�s a divorcee, DUMP HIM. HE will just leave you too if it deems him fit to after marriage and VIRGIN OR NOT HE NEEDS TO BE PATIENT AND RESPECT YOUR BOUNDARIES EVEN IF YOURE A PROSTITUTE. I hate touchy men�.like lay off..if he wants to simply hold your hand, say NO. DONT BE AFRAID TO SAY NO EVER. YOU SHOULD NOT EVEN WANT TO COPULATE WITH HIM TO IMPRESS HIM, TO MAKE HIM FEEL GOOD, NOTHING LIKE THAT ASTAGHFIRULLAH AND HE WILL JUST THINK YOU�RE EASY AND THEN GUESS WHAT LEAVE YOU AFTER GETTING WHAT HE WANTS , OR IT JUST NEVER GOES WELL. SOMETIMES THE ""MUSLIM"" GUY WANTS TO COPULATE WITH A NON-VIRGIN MUSLIM WOMEN JUST AS SHE'S LOOKING FOR A GOOD MUSLIM MAN BECAUSE HE WANTS TO SCREW HER LIKE IN DIFF POSITIONS LIKE BUNNIES AND TOO ASHAMED TO ASK A GOOD AND FAITHFUL MUSLIM WOMAN.� I never really thought about this part before but Daniella is right, shame on some families � ESPECIALLY ABOUT HOW SHE SAID that is just scary how they give you std�s astaghfirullah�astaghfirullah astaghfirullah.�

�2) the haram police- unfortunately, I grew up around one. I don't want to disrespect him cause he's my father, but you really do need to look out for this. or you'll get screwed over really bad and you'll be responsible for both your misery and your children's. you can only blame yourself for not getting to know your husband better prior to marriage, never be blaming your children as some do. leave your children out of it cause they have enough on their plate to deal with. I don't ever want to have kids because of this lifestyle I've experienced. it's disgusting to treat your children like shit for your failing marriage. it's disgusting cause your husband already places restrictions on all of you, speaks to you like you're an idiot , makes you feel like garbage , takes your kindness for weakness or for granted, doesn't let you do anything has a problem with everything you do doesn't let you breathe or be yourself. misogynist and sexist basically. too damn ""traditional"".� and then you gotta unleash your unhappiness on someone so you take it out on your kid to the point they want to off themselves because of both of you. ....ugh just don't. also, like I said earlier. Don�t be with a guy who tells you what to do. It is YOURE job to follow God, youre relationship with God is private. if he says something like this but you still find that he is still silently judging you �he�s lying he just wants to control you. Just run you don�t need a manipulative scumbag for a husband.�

�3) the broke guy- you need someone working to be able to build a life ..I mean for me it�s not too important, I dont plan to have any children I�m serious I�ve decided I might need to get infertile, so just being able to live in a small apartment is fine, but someone who sits home and plays video games 24/7 without working ?� Why are you even with them I�m sorry as harsh as it sounds you have to dump him� I get it being motivated in life is hard, but the proper muslim man is someone who takes his religion seriously , yet humble, and works to please Allah swt, and his parents. And of course his wife which is equally important if not more.�playing video games is FINE but he needs to know when enough is enough.

4)the green card- YEP . So many of them just want a ticket here you never know. there are so many munafiqs living in muslim countries. I never liked the idea for this reason. Maybe you can get to know someone there, by actually going there, while� keeping your western identity a secret, until you figure out they�re a good muslim and THEN reveal you�re Canadian/american, Australian or whatever. Other than that, I dont know.�like Daniella said , and like I came to accept, just wait for a good man for God to send you right where you are. 

5)someone who doesn�t care- Daniella is right men should convert for Allah swt only not for you. I personally have always loved to be with someone who was always kind and good, and may have converted to islam, or with someone who was always a muslim and I mean a good muslim. that is very virtuous but also obeying and fearing God. Otherwise I doubt they will take their religion seriously if they convert for the girl , ... I dont believe in love personally. It�s all effort a girl has to put in to flirting or batting her eyelashes or something I dont know. That will make the guy crazy for her and convert for all the wrong reasons which won't last.i've seen relationships like that happen and fail, I've seen them last too but ...I never see either of them practicing islam...so idk. Let me Tell you something on judgement day, this silly life won�t even matter it will all be a DREAM we will hardly remember. Nothing matters except Allah swt, and the kind of muslim you are to get you closer to him, to be under his protection and to enter JANNAH. When you think you can change him with your tricks remember YOU CANT, the fact that youre playing games is HARAM and he will just think youre CRAZY IN THE END ANYWAYS AND THEN YOU EITHER CRY OVER BEING EMOTINALLY DRAINED AND EXHAUSTED FROM TRYING TO KEEP HIM WRAPPED AROUND YOUR FINGER OR FROM HIS MENTAL RETARDATION RUBBING OFF ON YOU.



LADIES JUST TRY TO IMPRESS ALLAH SWT ONLY. BEING HUMBLE HAVING COURAGE HAVING KINDNESS HAVING PATIENCE HAVING HUMILITY. NONE OF THIS IS A WEAKNESS. FORGET ANYONE THAT THINKS THAT OF YOU. NO ONE IS WORTH IT IN THIS WORLD TO PLEASE EXCEPT ALLAH SWT.� I IMPLORE YOU , PLEASE REALIZE THIS AND DEVOTE YOURSELF TO ALLAH SWT ONLY. SCREW MEN AND IN THIS ERA AND PERIOD OF TIME TODAY THEY ARE ALL WORSE THAN EVER. JUST PRAY TO GOD AND HE WILL SEND YOU SOMEONE EITHER HERE OR IN THE HEREAFTER. YOUR MISSION IS TO FOLLOW GOD ONLY IN THIS DUNYA.",0
I definitely agree I was laughing my life when you talked about the one-way trip and for that guy who says women can't go to work well excuse me little guy but that's PURE sexism,0
Religiousness is not judged but us rather by Allah,0
"But you make it seem like all foreign men are bad in the end of your video..telling women ""no, don't do it"".. which isn't always the case.. I've seen so many beautiful long lasting relationships from the east and from the west that joined together by the permission of Allah Subhana wa ta'ala. Alhamdulillah for everything, may Allah make it easy for all marriages and keep us all safe and protect us all from deceit, evil and lies .",0
"Also a homophobic Muslim guys is the last person you wanna marry, you should mention that",0
YAAZZ sis! You say it!!,0
so we're not going to talk about how GORGEOUS she actually is? You're soo beautiful mashallahh,0
YES THIS! SPILL THE TEA SIS. literally this is why I don�t just assume if the guy is Muslim we all good to go. It�s so complicated especially finding a good one in the west that is also not a �haram police� but also not a hoe. I just can�t even.,0
